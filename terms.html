        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="legal-meta">Last updated: February 21, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. About This Service</h2>
        <p>ARK InkBook ("InkBook", "we", "us") is a booking and client management tool designed for tattoo artists. By
            creating an account or using our platform, you agree to these terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>You must provide accurate information when creating your account. You are responsible for maintaining the
            security of your account credentials. If you suspect unauthorized access, contact us immediately.</p>

        <h2>3. What We Provide</h2>
        <p>InkBook offers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A public booking page for your clients</li>
            <li>Flash design gallery management</li>
            <li>Digital consent form collection</li>
            <li>Client and booking management dashboard</li>
            <li>Deposit collection through third-party payment providers (PayPal)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We continuously improve our features and may update the platform at any time.</p>

        <h2>4. Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>InkBook offers free and paid subscription plans. Paid plans are billed monthly through PayPal. You can cancel
            your subscription at any time — cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period.</p>
        <p>Deposit payments between artists and clients are processed by PayPal. InkBook is not responsible for disputes
            between artists and their clients regarding payments, refunds, or services rendered.</p>

        <h2>5. Refunds & Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Subscription refunds:</strong> Since subscriptions can be cancelled at any time and cancellation
            takes effect at the end of the billing period, we do not offer refunds for partial months. If you cancel
            mid-cycle, you retain access until the end of your current billing period.</p>
        <p><strong>Client deposit refunds:</strong> Deposits paid by clients to artists are transactions between the
            artist and client via PayPal. Refund disputes for deposits should be resolved directly between the artist
            and client, or through PayPal's dispute resolution process. InkBook does not hold or manage deposit funds.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Platform fees:</strong> The 5% platform fee on completed bookings is non-refundable once the booking
            is marked as completed.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Content</h2>
        <p>You retain ownership of all content you upload (designs, profile information, etc.). By uploading content,
            you
            grant InkBook a limited license to display it within the platform as needed for the service to function
            (e.g., showing your flash designs on your booking page). This license ends when you delete your account.</p>

        <h2>7. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the platform for any illegal activity</li>
            <li>Upload content that infringes on others' intellectual property</li>
            <li>Attempt to interfere with or disrupt the service</li>
            <li>Create fake accounts or impersonate others</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Consent Forms</h2>
        <p>InkBook provides digital consent form tools as a convenience. It is the artist's responsibility to ensure
            their consent forms meet the legal requirements of their local jurisdiction. InkBook does not provide legal
            advice.</p>

        <h2>9. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>We aim to keep InkBook available at all times, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted service. We may perform
            maintenance or updates that temporarily affect availability.</p>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>InkBook is provided "as is." We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising
            from your use of the service, including but not limited to lost revenue, missed bookings, or client
            disputes.</p>

        <h2>11. Account Deletion & Withdrawal</h2>
        <p>You may request to delete your account at any time through the Settings page or by contacting us. When you
            delete your account:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your profile, booking page, and flash gallery will be taken offline immediately</li>
            <li>Your uploaded content (flash designs, profile images) will be permanently deleted</li>
            <li>Booking records and client consent forms will be retained for 30 days for record-keeping, then
                permanently deleted</li>
            <li>Any active paid subscription will be cancelled — no further charges will occur</li>
            <li>Remaining subscription period access is forfeited upon account deletion</li>
            <li>Outstanding deposit transactions between you and clients are not affected, as they were processed
                through PayPal independently</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms from time to time. When we make significant changes, we will notify registered
            users via email. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
