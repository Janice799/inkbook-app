            numbers, bank accounts, or other financial information on our servers.</p>
        <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect basic usage information such as pages visited and features used
            to
            improve the service.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <ul>

        <h2>4. Where Your Data Is Stored</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored using Google Firebase services (Firestore and Firebase Storage). Firebase infrastructure
            is managed by Google Cloud Platform. For more details on Firebase's security practices, see <a
                href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Privacy and
                Security</a>.</p>

        <p>We do not sell your data. We do not share your personal information with third parties for marketing
            purposes. Your data may be shared only in these cases:</p>

            applicable local laws.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention & Account Deletion</h2>
